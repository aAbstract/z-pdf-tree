Methods and responsibilities for establishing aerodrome 
operating minima. 
GACAR Part 121.1209, APP G – (A)(8) IOSA 3.11.4 
The term "minima" refers to specific weather conditions at an aerodrome. It defines the minimum 
horizontal visibility and ceiling required for an aircraft to take off or land at that aerodrome. Aerodrome 
operating minima (AOM) are expressed in terms of Runway Visual Range (RVR), Visibility, Decision 
Altitude (DA), Decision Height (DH), or Minimum Descent Altitude/Height (MDA/H). These AOM values 
are shown on Take-off Minimum Charts and Approach Charts and are never below the minimum values 
prescribed by the State. 
8.1.3.1 
Types of Minima 
8.1.3.1.1 
Aerodrome Operating Minima 
Aerodrome operating minima specify the limits of usability of an aerodrome for either take-off or 
landing. The minima for take-off are expressed in terms of Runway Visual Range (RVR) and/or visibility, 
and if applicable, ceiling. For landing, minima are expressed as follows: 
1. 
2D Approach Operations: minima are expressed in terms of visibility and/or RVR and Minimum 
Descent Altitude/Height (MDA/H).  
2. 
3D Approach Operations: minima are expressed in terms of visibility and/or RVR and Decision 
Altitude/Height (DA/H), as appropriate to the type of operation. 
Operating minima are established for each departure, destination, and alternate aerodrome intended 
to be utilized. These minima are meant to ensure adequate separation from terrain and obstacles, 
preventing the loss of visual references during the visual flight segment during take-off and during the 
visual flight segment of an instrument approach and landing. 
Note: Navigation charts (i.e., Take-off Minimum and Approach) depict aerodrome operating minima that 
are applicable to all Riyadh Air flight operations. 
When establishing aerodrome operating minima for take-off and landing all of the following 
elements are taken into account: 
1. 
The type, performance, and handling characteristics of the aeroplane, 
2. 
The composition of the Flight Crew, their qualification and experience,

1. 
The aircraft dispatcher performs a preflight RAIM prediction for that alternate aerodrome and 
finds it satisfactory for the ETA; 
2. 
At the destination aerodrome, the flight crew may fly a non-GPS-based IAP. 
An aerodrome served by an NPA only, with the underlying navigation aid (NDB, VOR, or DME) out-of-
service or compatible aircraft avionics not operational (ADF, VOR, or DME), may not be used for planning 
purposes as an alternate aerodrome. Refer to the OpSpec C83. 
If no IAP has been published under GACAR Part 97 for the alternate aerodrome, the ceiling and visibility 
minima are those allowing descent from the minimum enroute altitude (MEA), approach, and landing 
under basic VFR.

This document shall be acceptable to the PIC, his acceptance being indicated by countersignature or 
equivalent. 
The PIC shall be advised when a non-standard method has been used for determining the mass of the 
traffic load. This method shall be stated in the mass and balance documentation. 
The PIC may accept an updated mass and balance documentation after doors closed and prior to 
departure corrected for any gross error. 
8.1.8.6.1 
ACARS Load sheet 
When a load sheet is sent via datalink, the name and license number of the person preparing the mass 
and balance documentation is shown on the ACARS load sheet. 
The PIC shall accept, or reject, the ACARS load sheet via datalink including his staff number. (Method of 
accepting the load sheet to be confirmed) 
Normally, there is a system generated acknowledgement when the PIC accepts or rejects an ACARS load 
sheet. Nevertheless, this is not a requirement. 
When rejecting an ACARS load sheet, the PIC should coordinate with either Load Control (DXB) or the 
responsible ground personnel (other than RUH) to resolve the issue. 
The ACARS load sheet may be printed for a Last-Minute Change (LMC) or when requested by the ground 
personnel. 
When using the ACARS load sheet, manual signatures are not required by either the PIC nor the person 
supervising the loading, unless datalink becomes unserviceable or requested by ground personnel. 
8.1.8.6.2 
Last Minute Change (LMC) 
Any changes in traffic load and/or fuel after the completion of the mass and balance documentation 
shall be brought to the attention of the PIC and the LMC shall be entered on the mass and balance 
documentation. 
Before accepting the LMC, the PIC shall ensure that the person preparing the mass and balance 
documentation has verified that: 
1. 
The LMC does not exceed the calculated underload or any mass limitation of the airplane, 
2. 
The load limitations of compartments and loading positions are not exceeded, and 
3. 
The center of gravity stays within the allowed limits. 
If the maximum allowed LMC is exceeded, a new mass and balance documentation shall be prepared. 
If the actual baggage weight is not available to be used for the LMC, 20 kg per bag shall be used. 
The LMC limitations apply as follows: 
1. 
Individual or total LMC shall be 500 kg or less (Note 1),

Air Traffic Services (ATS) Flight Plan 
GACAR §121.1509, 121.1513, 91.73 
With the exception of training, Maintenance Check Flights, demonstration, and sightseeing flights, 
regardless of the meteorological conditions, no flights shall be commenced unless an ATS IFR flight plan 
has been submitted, or adequate information has been deposited in order to permit alerting services 
to be activated if required. 
Flight Dispatch is responsible for filing the ATS flight plan. If not available, this responsibility rests with 
the PIC. If communication facilities are not readily available, the ATS flight plan may be filed as soon as 
practical by radio communication after take-off. 
Unless national regulations require otherwise, the ATS flight plan will normally be filed at least one hour 
before the expected time of departure. 
In the event of an expected delay of 30 minutes or more to the estimated time of departure, an ATS 
flight plan should be amended, or the old ATS flight plan should be cancelled with a new ATS flight plan 
to be submitted. 
The ATS flight plan is normally automatically closed by the local ATS unit when a flight has landed at its 
destination aerodrome.  
In exceptional circumstances and when unable to close the ATS flight plan due to lack of ATS facilities 
or communications, the PIC shall ensure that an alternative means of closing the ATS flight plan is used.

8.2.1.4 
Precautions to avoid mixing fuels 
‘Wide cut fuel’ (designated JET B, JP-4 or AVTAG) is an aviation turbine fuel that falls between gasoline 
and kerosene in the distillation range and consequently, compared to kerosene (JET A, JET A1, JP8, TS1, 
RT and TH), it has the properties of higher volatility (vapor pressure), lower flash point and lower freezing 
point. Wherever possible, Riyadh Air shall avoid the use of wide-cut fuel types.  
If a situation arises such that only wide-cut fuels are available for refueling and use of wide cut fuel is 
permitted in the AMM, Flight Crew members should be aware that mixtures of wide-cut fuels and 
kerosene turbine fuels can result in the air/fuel mixture in the tank being in the combustible range at 
ambient temperatures.  
The extra precautions set out below are advisable to avoid arcing in the tank due to electrostatic 
discharge. The risk of this type of arcing can be minimized by the use of a static dissipation additive in 
the fuel. When this additive is present in the proportions stated in the fuel specification, the normal 
fueling precautions set out below are considered adequate.  
Wide-cut fuel is considered to be “involved” when it is being supplied or when it is already present in 
airplane fuel tanks. When wide-cut fuel has been used, this should be recorded in the Aircraft Technical 
Log.

The next two uplifts of fuel should be treated as though they too involve the use of wide-cut fuel. When 
refueling with turbine fuels not containing a static dissipater, and where wide-cut fuels are involved, a 
substantial reduction on fueling flow rate is advisable. Reduced flow rate, as recommended by fuel 
suppliers and/or airplane manufacturers, has the following benefits:  
1. 
It allows more time for any static charge build-up in the fueling equipment to dissipate before 
the fuel enters the tank,  
2. 
It reduces any charge which may build up due to splashing and, 
3. 
Until the fuel inlet point is immersed, it reduces misting in the tank and consequently the 
extension of the flammable range of the fuel. 
The flow rate reduction necessary is dependent upon the fueling equipment in use and the type of 
filtration employed on the airplane fueling distribution system. It is difficult, therefore, to quote precise 
flow rates. With over-wing fueling, splashing should be avoided by making sure that the delivery nozzle 
extends as far as practicable into the tank. 
8.2.1.5 
Fuel Uplift Check (Gross Error Check) 
Prior to departure, a fuel uplift check shall be conducted in accordance with the respective type specific 
documentation. Any discrepancy outside the defined limits shall be investigated and entered in the 
Aircraft Technical Log. 
Condition 
Limit 
Actual fuel uplift more than calculated fuel uplift 
5% of calculated fuel uplift up to a maximum of 
2,000 kg 
Actual fuel uplift less than calculated fuel uplift 
5% of calculated uplift up to a maximum of 1,000 
kg 
Table 41 Fuel Uplift Check and limits 
Actual fuel uplift:  
Supplied fuel quantity x fuel density.  
Calculated fuel uplift:  
Aeroplane indicated fuel quantity after fueling minus airplane indicated fuel 
quantity before fueling. 
8.2.1.6 
Fuel Freezing Point 
The variation of the freezing point of a fuel mixture is not linear. Therefore, the only reliable way to 
obtain an accurate freeze point of a mixture of fuels is to make an actual freeze point measurement. 
When this is not possible, apply as follows:

Any required accompanying able-bodied persons/attendants in addition to the standard Cabin Crew 
will be responsible for the passenger’s comfort, as well as their safety and assistance during emergency 
evacuation. Where appropriate, groups will be subdivided into smaller groups, depending on the 
airplane type, and shall be seated in areas specifically designated for the purpose. 
8.2.2.2.7 
Evacuation Procedure 
Cabin Crew are responsible for the evacuation of all passengers able to reach the emergency exits 
without assistance. Passengers requiring assistance will be evacuated by their escorts, Cabin/Flight Crew, 
and able-bodied passengers, depending on the situation. 
8.2.2.2.8 
Passenger on Stretchers and in Incubators 
An escort shall accompany passengers on stretchers and in incubators. The PIC and the Purser shall be 
advised that a stretcher case is on-board. Seat belts and harnesses shall be fastened when the seat belt 
sign is illuminated. 
8.2.2.2.9 
Safety Briefing for Passenger with Disability 
Refer to OME 
8.2.2.2.10 Acceptance of Persons with Reduced Mobility (PRM) 
The acceptance of these passengers is divided into non-US and US operations (to, from or transiting 
the US). 
Non-US Acceptance Criteria: 
For those passengers that require medical clearance, Riyadh Air Medical Services decide whether or not 
to approve travel and will specify the conditions under which the passenger will be accepted, including 
any special handling arrangements.  
Certificates of fitness to travel by air issued by private doctors or government hospitals do not constitute 
approval to travel. 
US Acceptance Criteria (to, from or transiting the US): 
DOT regulations (14 CFR Part 382) mandate that a commercial air operator shall carry passengers with 
disabilities on a nondiscriminatory basis, from a point within US territory to a point outside US territory 
and vice versa. 
A certificate of fitness to travel by air issued by a private doctor or hospital does constitute approval to 
travel on a flight that originates, terminates, or transits the US. 
The regulations mandate that each carrier designate a Complaints Resolution Officer (CRO) who are 
individuals trained to be experts in ensuring that company personnel correctly implement the provisions 
of the Part 382 regulations.

The CROs have the authority to direct company personnel (except the PIC with respect to safety matters) 
to take actions to resolve problems as quickly as possible before a violation occurs. 
The PIC shall not refuse carriage once the passenger with a disability has been accepted, except on the 
grounds of safety. If a passenger is refused carriage, the PIC shall submit a written report justifying the 
offloading of the passenger, countermanding the decision of the CRO, within 24 hours of return to base 
and may be required to submit further reports as required by the DOT.

Riyadh Air has established policies and procedures, incorporating risk assessment, for the secure 
transport of inadmissible passengers and deportees in compliance with judicial or administrative orders. 
For inadmissible passengers, information is gathered from relevant authorities to assess risks to flight 
security, including:  
1. 
Reason for inadmissibility (nature of offense)  
2. 
Willingness to travel/escape risk  
3. 
History of violence or self-harm  
4. 
Mental/physical state  
5. 
Need for escorts  
6. 
Wanted status  
7. 
Other risks to flight security Mitigation measures are implemented based on risk assessments.  
High-risk cases may be denied boarding if posing unacceptable safety risks. Enhanced monitoring, 
security and restraints may be required. For deportees, Riyadh Air coordinates with authorities to ensure 
safe handover and security escorts. Relevant information is shared with originating and subsequent 
operating airlines. Transit and destination airports are informed of the deportee's status.  
8.2.2.4.1 
Inadmissible Passengers (INADs)  
INADs are passengers refused entry to a destination state by authorities, usually due to invalid or 
missing documentation like visas or passports.  
There are two types of INADs:  
1. 
INAD 1 - Refused entry due to expired or missing visa/passport. Pose no airline risk and are 
boarded normally. Can keep travel documents inflight. No special seating required.  
2. 
INAD 2 - Refused entry due to dubious or forged documents. Pre-boarded and travel documents 
collected by purser to prevent destruction. Seated in last economy row to monitor.  
Note: If an INAD actively refuses to return to their departure point, they become a deportee (DEPA) and 
should be escorted. The key distinctions are that INAD 1s pose no concern and travel normally, while INAD 
2s require document collection and monitoring due to higher risk.   
8.2.2.4.2 
Deportees (DEPU/DEPA)  
Deportees (DEPU/DEPA) refer to passengers who previously entered a country legally or illegally, and 
are now being formally expelled by government authorities, often involuntarily. Key procedures for 
handling deportee passengers:  
1. 
Accompanied deportees (DEPA) pose a flight security risk and must be escorted.

potential hazard to the safety of the airplane or its occupants. The PIC shall not allow a person to be 
carried in the airplane who appears to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs* to the extent that the 
safety of the airplane, the crew or its occupants is likely to be endangered.  
(*) This does not apply to medical patients under proper care.  
The PIC shall not allow any person to board the airplane who might be the source of infection, or who 
appears to have a disease that may cause discomfort to other passengers. The PIC may not allow 
passengers onboard the airplane whose conduct, status, mental or physical condition is determined 
such as to render them incapable of assisting in their own evacuation of the airplane unless they are

onward carriage should be refused to a disruptive passenger, the passenger may be denied a boarding 
pass. If a boarding pass has been issued, ground personnel will take such steps as are appropriate and 
reasonable in the circumstances to prevent the passenger boarding the airplane.  
Checked (hold) baggage of the disruptive passenger shall be offloaded.  
Authority of the PIC 
The PIC may refuse the carriage or onward carriage to any disruptive passenger and is ultimately 
responsible for the decision to exclude a passenger from carriage.

8.2.4 
De-icing and Anti-icing on the Ground 
The Riyadh Air policy in respect of operations in ground icing conditions is: 
Make It Clean, Keep It Clean 
Any deposit of frost, ice, snow, or slush on the external surfaces of an airplane may drastically affect its 
flying qualities because of reduced aerodynamic lift, increased drag, modified stability, and control 
characteristics. Furthermore, freezing deposits may cause moving parts, such as elevators, ailerons, flap 
actuating mechanism, etc., to jam and create a potentially hazardous condition.  
Engine/APU/systems performance may deteriorate due to the presence of frozen contaminants to 
blades, intakes, and components. Engine operation may be seriously affected by the ingestion of snow 
or ice, thereby causing engine stall or compressor damage. In addition, ice/frost may form on certain 
external surfaces, such as wing upper and lower surfaces, due to the effects of cold fuel/structures, even 
in ambient temperatures well above 0°C.  
The removal of such contamination prior to take-off shall be strictly adhered to. The effectiveness of 
any de-icing/anti-icing program for the removal of ice, snow or frost and subsequent prevention of 
build-up, depends on awareness of the condition, the type of fluid used, and its proper handling and 
application.  
Riyadh Air does not conduct de-icing/anti-icing but rather utilizes contractors to perform this function. 
However, all Riyadh Air personnel share the responsibility for ensuring that no airplane is dispatched 
unless it is completely clear of ice, snow, or frost.  
Take-off shall not be attempted if frost, snow, ice, or other contaminants are adhering to the lifting 
surfaces or flight controls of the airplane.  
Regulations provide that a light coating of frost is permissible on the top of the fuselage, and up to 3 
mm (1/8 in) thickness of frost is permitted on the under surface of the wing due to fuel cold soaking.  
All fuselage vents, leading edge devices, control surfaces, horizontal stabilizers and the upper surfaces 
of the wings shall be completely clean of all adhering contaminants. There is no such thing as an 
insignificant amount of ice or a little frost. A very small amount of roughness, in thickness as low as 0.40 
mm (1/64 in), caused by ice, snow or frost, disrupts the air flow over the lift and control surfaces of an 
airplane. The consequences of this roughness are severe lift loss, increased drag, and impaired 
maneuverability, particularly during the take-off and initial climb phases of flight. Ice can also interfere 
with the movement of control surfaces or add significantly to airplane weight. 
Holdover times do not imply that flight is safe in the prevailing conditions, even if the specified holdover 
time has not been exceeded. Under certain meteorological conditions de-icing and/or anti-icing 
procedures may be ineffective in providing sufficient protection for continued operations and may be 
beyond the certification envelope of the airplane.

Performance Based Navigation (PBN) exists under the umbrella of area navigation (RNAV). The term 
RNAV in this context, as in procedure titles, means “area navigation,” regardless of the equipment 
capability of the aircraft. (See Fig 1-2-1)  
Within PBN there are two main categories of navigation methods or specifications: area navigation 
(RNAV) and required navigation performance (RNP). In this context, the term RNAV x means a specific 
navigation specification with a specified lateral accuracy value.  
For an aircraft to meet the requirements of PBN, a specified RNAV or RNP accuracy must be met 95 
percent of the flight time.  
Required Navigational Performance (RNP) is a PBN requirement for which the aircraft has onboard 
performance monitoring and alerting capability.  The RNP values are shown on the ND and in the FMC.  
The aircraft provides alerts when the Actual Navigational Performance (ANP) does not satisfy the RNP.  
PBN also introduces the concept of navigation specifications (NavSpecs) which are a set of aircraft and 
aircrew requirements needed to support a navigation application within a defined airspace concept.  
For both RNP and RNAV NavSpecs, the numerical designation refers to the lateral navigation accuracy 
in nautical miles which is expected to be achieved at least 95 percent of the flight time by the population 
of aircraft operating within the airspace, route, or procedure.  
This information is detailed in International Civil Aviation Organization's (ICAO) Doc 9613, Performance-
based Navigation (PBN) Manual. 
The table below outlines existing and future Navigation Specification designations: 
 
Figure 3 Navigation Specification 
For RNAV 1, RNAV 2, RNP 1, RNP 2 and RNP APCH, the flight crew shall not modify or insert waypoints 
into any departure, arrival or approach procedure that has been retrieved from the navigation database.

Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS)/Airborne Collision 
Avoidance System (ACAS)  
GACAR PART 121 APPENDIX G – (a) (33), 91.237   IOSA 3.11.3 
The Traffic Collision and Avoidance System (TCAS) is to be used on all flights in accordance with 
respective type specific documentation unless special approval dictates differently.  
It remains the responsibility of the Flight Crew to avoid collision with another airplane. During critical 
phases of the flight, including in the vicinity of an aerodrome, during descent and climb-out, and in 
areas where traffic is dense, Flight Crew shall keep additional workload, such as completing paperwork, 
map reading, etc., to a minimum.  
Use of the autopilot is recommended to facilitate a good lookout. ATC only reports known traffic. If 
unidentified traffic is reported by ATC, and a collision risk is suspected, request immediate avoiding 
action.  
Only ICAO standard phraseology as listed in (4) below shall be used in relation to TCAS.  
Indications generated by TCAS shall be used by pilots in conformity with the following safety 
considerations: 
1. 
Traffic Advisory (TA):  
a. 
Flight Crew shall not maneuver an airplane in response to a TA. Following a TA, Flight Crew 
shall prepare for appropriate action if an RA occurs.  
2. 
Resolution Advisories (RA):  
a. 
Flight Crew shall follow all RAs. Visually acquired traffic may not be the same traffic as has 
triggered an RA. Visual perception of an encounter may be misleading, particularly at 
nighttime. ATC may not know when TCAS issues RAs. It is possible for ATC to issue 
instructions that are unknowingly contrary to RA indications.  
3. 
The alteration of flight path shall be limited to the minimum extent necessary to comply with the 
RA.  
4. 
Pilots who deviate from an ATC instruction or clearance in response to an RA shall:  
a. 
After initiating the maneuver, and as soon as permitted by Flight Crew workload, notify the 
appropriate ATC unit of the deviation as follows: “(Call Sign), TCAS RA”.  
b. 
Promptly return to the terms of the ATC instruction or clearance when the conflict is 
resolved.

d. 
If ATC issues an instruction contradictory to an RA, pilots shall follow the RA and inform 
ATC: “(Call Sign), Unable, TCAS RA”.  
In order to reduce unnecessary TCAS alerts, the vertical speed should be limited to 1,500 ft/min or less 
when within 1,000 ft of the assigned altitude/ FL when in proximity of other traffic and it is safe and 
practical to do so. 
8.3.7 
Policy and Procedures for In-flight Fuel Management 
GACAR Part 121.1383 
Riyadh Air Policy is that the Pilot in Command (PIC) must continually ensure the amount of usable fuel 
remaining on board is not less than the fuel required to proceed to an aerodrome where a safe landing 
can be made with the planned final reserve fuel remaining upon landing. 
The PIC must request delay information from ATC when unanticipated circumstances may result in 
landing at the destination aerodrome with less than the final reserve fuel plus any fuel required to 
proceed to an alternate aerodrome or the fuel required to operate to an isolated aerodrome. 
8.3.7.1 
In-Flight Fuel Checks 
Routing fuel checks are compulsory at regular intervals not exceeding 30 minutes and shall be recorded 
on the OFP and evaluated to: 
1. 
Compare actual consumption with planned consumption,  
2. 
Check that the usable remaining fuel is sufficient to complete the flight. 
If the trend during in-flight fuel checks is negative and a fuel leak can be discounted in accordance with 
the respective type specific documentation, then the Flight Crew should consider appropriate corrective 
actions, such as, but not limited to:  
1. 
Decreasing speed/cost index  
2. 
Requesting direct routes or a more optimum flight level  
3. 
Selecting a closer destination alternate aerodrome 
8.3.7.2 
In-Flight Delay and Fuel Management 
If, during an in-flight fuel check, the expected fuel on arrival at the destination is less then alternate fuel 
plus final reserve fuel, the PIC may continue towards the destination aerodrome under the following 
provisions:  
1. 
Expected Approach Time (EAT) not known:

a. 
Flight may continue towards the destination aerodrome if it is possible to reach at least 
two aerodromes at which a landing is assured with at least final reserve fuel remaining at 
touchdown. Two separate and independent runways at a single aerodrome within two 
hours of flying time may be considered to be equivalent to two aerodromes, provided that 
account is taken of fuel burn due to any likely ATC delay.  
2. 
Expected Approach Time (EAT) known:  
a. 
Regardless of the number of runways, the flight may continue towards the destination 
aerodrome or hold, as long as landing is assured with at least final reserve fuel remaining 
at touchdown. A landing is considered to be assured as long as, in the judgement of the 
PIC, the approach and landing could be completed in the event of any forecast 
deterioration in the weather and plausible single failures of ground or airborne facilities.  
When more than two hours from the relevant aerodrome, weather forecasts should be used to assess 
the probability of landing success.  
Within two hours from the relevant aerodrome, actual weather reports and trend information may be 
used. 
8.3.7.3 
Minimum Fuel 
The PIC must advise ATC of a minimum fuel state by declaring MINIMUM FUEL when, having committed 
to land at a specific aerodrome, the pilot calculates that any change to the existing clearance to that 
aerodrome may result in landing with less than the planned final reserve fuel. 
The declaration of minimum fuel informs ATC that all planned aerodrome options have been reduced 
to a specific aerodrome of intended landing and any change to the existing clearance may result in 
landing with less than the planned final reserve fuel. This is not an emergency situation but an indication 
that an emergency situation is possible should any additional delay occur. 
8.3.7.4 
Mayday Fuel 
The PIC must declare a situation of fuel emergency by broadcasting MAYDAY MAYDAY MAYDAY FUEL, 
when the calculated usable fuel predicted to be available upon landing at the nearest aerodrome where 
a safe landing can be made is less than the planned final reserve fuel. 
8.3.8 
Adverse and Potentially Hazardous Atmospheric Conditions 
Dispatch Policy: 
Flights should not be dispatched or operated into or through areas of reported or forecast hazardous 
weather conditions. 
Take-off or landing in the vicinity of heavy thunderstorm activity is prohibited. For further information, 
refer to the OM-C.

Thunderstorms 
IOSA FLT 3.11.38 
Although a flight through areas of thunderstorm activity should be avoided wherever possible, provided 
that the recommended techniques are employed, such flight may be carried out where no alternative 
course of action is possible. 
Maximum use of weather radar shall be made to identify and assist in avoiding thunderstorm activity 
and turbulence. 
Strong weather radar echoes shall be avoided by at least 10 NM at or below FL200, and by at least 20 
NM above FL200. 
Approximately 80 percent of lightning strikes occur within plus or minus 3500 ft. of the freezing level. 
When electrified cells are present, maintain an appropriate distance from electrified cells. 
When possible, minimize time in the vicinity of the freezing level to reduce the potential for lightning 
strikes. 
8.3.8.2 
Icing Conditions 
Known areas of severe icing should be avoided. If severe icing is encountered, every effort shall be made 
to clear the area of severe icing as soon as possible. 
For further information, refer to the respective type specific documentation. 
For details regarding de-icing and anti-icing on the ground, refer to 8.2.4 and the OM-C XX

Turbulence 
IOSA FLT 3.11.38, 3.13.6 
1. 
If the weather conditions, cloud structure and route forecast indicate that turbulence is likely, the 
cabin crew shall be advised. If a turbulence encounter is imminent or unpredicted turbulence is 
encountered, switch the SEATBELTS sign on and advise passengers to return to, and/or remain in 
their seats, and to ensure that their seat belts/harnesses are securely fastened. 
2. 
If turbulence is expected or experienced, the aircraft should be flown at the recommended 
turbulence speed/Mach Number, in accordance with the FCOM. 
3. 
If operation in or through an area of turbulence is unavoidable, the following precautions shall 
be taken: 
a. 
Seat Belt Sign shall be switched on. 
b. 
The FAIC shall be notified, and a recommendation to limit or cease cabin service made, if 
appropriate.

Avoid altitudes approaching maximum cruise altitude in such circumstances. 
6. 
Clear air turbulence may sometimes be avoided by increasing/ decreasing the cruising level if 
operational considerations so permit. Monitoring of other aircraft reports also assists in 
avoidance. 
8.3.8.3.1 
Reporting of Turbulence 
When encountering significant turbulence, Flight Crews shall report such conditions to ATC as soon as 
practical. The report should include: 
1. 
Aeroplane position, 
2. 
Altitude or FL, 
3. 
Wind direction and velocity. 
When severe turbulence or any abnormal stress to the airplane, such as lightning strike, has been 
encountered, an Aircraft Technical Log entry shall be performed. This entry should include any actual or 
suspected exceedance of engine or airframe limitations. 
8.3.8.4 
Windshear 
Flight Crews shall remain alert to the possibility of windshear and be prepared to react positively and 
without delay. 
If a windshear is reported, expected, or encountered, refer to OM-C and the type specific 
documentation.

Avoid flying along the edge of Jetstreams due to possible associated turbulence. Pilots should also be 
aware of the effect of increased fuel consumption due to unexpected significant head wind components 
that can be encountered. 
8.3.8.6 
Volcanic Ash/Gasses 
IOSA FLT 3.11.38 
Flight Crew and dispatchers shall pay particular attention to any volcanic ash advisories. The format for 
such advisories is given in the meteorology section of route manual. 
If volcanic ash/dust is encountered inadvertently, exit immediately via the shortest route and apply the 
Volcanic Ash procedure located in the relevant FCOM. 
Refer to OM-C, Jeppesen Airways Manual, and the respective type specific documentation. 
8.3.8.7 
Heavy Precipitation 
Refer to OM-C, the Jeppesen Airway Manual, and the respective type specific documentation. 
8.3.8.8 
Sandstorm 
Avoid flying in active sandstorms wherever possible. Considerable damage can be done to an airplane’s 
windscreen, leading edges, and engine compressor blades by the abrasive action of sand particles. 
8.3.8.9 
Mountain Waves 
Mountain waves can form in the lee of a range of mountains, and are usually in the form of standing 
waves, with several miles between peaks and troughs. They can extend to 10,000 or 20,000 ft above the 
range and for up to 200 or 300 NM downwind. 
Flight Crew shall be aware of the areas and likely conditions for the formation of mountain waves, and 
act accordingly.  
Refer to OM-C and Jeppesen Airways Manual. 
8.3.8.10 Significant Temperature Inversion 
Ambient temperature variations influence airplane performance and inversions will usually affect 
performance adversely. 
Large temperature inversions encountered shortly after take-off can seriously degrade an airplane’s 
climb performance, particularly at high operating mass. Similarly, if the airplane is operating to a 
maximum landing mass limited by go-around climb performance considerations, the required gradient 
may not be achieved. 
The maximum cruising altitude capability of the airplane can be significantly reduced if a temperature 
inversion of even small magnitude exists in the upper levels. This may prevent an airplane reaching its

preferred cruising altitude. Should an airplane encounter an area of inversion once in the cruise at 
limiting altitude its buffet margins may be so eroded that a descent is necessary. 
Temperature inversions at lower levels in the atmosphere are frequently associated with deteriorating 
visibility and can prevent the clearance of fog for prolonged periods. Light wind conditions and clear 
skies at night can lead to rapid cooling of the earth and a morning temperature inversion at ground 
level. 
8.3.9 
Wake Turbulence 
For take-off, approach and landing, ATC generally provides longitudinal separation depending on the 
Wake Turbulence Category (WTC) or Wake Turbulence Group (WTG) of the airplane.

8.3.10.6 Controlled Rest on the Flight Deck 
Controlled rest on the flight deck is one of several measures that can be taken to counter the effects of 
tiredness resulting from sleep disturbance and circadian disruption. Its use has been shown to 
significantly increase levels of alertness during the later phases of flight. 
Controlled rest is a period which does not include any tasks and may include actual sleep. 
Controlled rest may be used at the discretion of the PIC to manage both sudden unexpected fatigue 
and fatigue which is expected to become more severe during higher workload periods later in the flight. 
It cannot be planned before flight. 
Controlled rest on the flight deck is permitted subject to the following: 
1. 
Handover of duties and wake-up arrangements shall be reviewed, 
2. 
Cabin Crew shall be made aware that control rest is planned, 
3. 
Only one pilot may take controlled rest at any given time, 
4. 
Controlled rest may only be taken in the dedicated pilot seat, 
5. 
Controlled rest shall not be planned during periods of expected higher workload, such as FL 
changes, poor weather conditions, etc. 
Before the controlled rest, any physiological needs of either Flight Crew member should be completed, 
and the PF shall verify the communication system is operational and appropriately configured. 
While both pilots shall remain at their stations, the controlled rest should not exceed a period of 40 min 
to avoid sleep inertia on wakening. Suitable equipment, such as eye shades, neck supports, ear plugs, 
etc. may be used by the resting pilot. 
There should be a period of at least 20 min after wakeup without any duties or briefing to enable the 
resting pilot to awake fully. After the end of this period, a handover briefing shall be conducted. The 
communication system shall be checked to be operational. 
8.3.10.7 Designated PIC During Training Flights 
The Training Captain is the designated PIC if assigned as the operating crew member on a training duty.

8.3.19.2.22.3.1 RNAV Visual Flight Procedures (RVFP) 
RNAV Visual Flight Procedures (RVFP) are visual approaches utilizing lateral and vertical guidance 
published by the State of the aerodrome. 
The RVFP shall be coded in the FMC/FMS and pilots are not authorized to build these procedures 
manually. 
The Flight Crew should request the RVFP on initial contact with ATC, unless previously coordinated, and 
should report the aerodrome or preceding traffic in sight to receive clearance for such a procedure. 
The Flight Crew should fly the published RVFP route and, unless otherwise cleared by ATC, comply with 
charted mandatory altitudes and speeds. 
8.3.19.2.22.3.2 Charted Visual Flight Procedures (CVFP) 
(IOSA FLT 3.11.58, 3.11.64) 
Charted Visual Flight Procedures (CVFP) are charted visual approaches established for environmental 
and noise considerations or when necessary, for the safety and efficiency of air traffic operations 
published by the State of the aerodrome. Lateral and vertical navigation for CVFPs will be made with 
reference to prominent landmarks. Although some NAVAIDs may be depicted, these are for 
supplemental navigation only. 
8.3.19.2.22.4 Circling Approach 
(IOSA FLT 3.11.58, 3.11.69) 
A circling approach is the visual phase of an instrument approach to bring an aeroplane into position 
for landing on a runway which is not suitably located for a straight-in approach. 
Circling approaches without enhanced coding are not permitted unless approved by VP-FO or his 
designee. 
For further information, refer to OM-C, Enhanced Coded Approach Procedures. 
After the aeroplane has left the track of the initial (let-down) instrument approach, the flight phase 
outbound from the runway shall be limited to an appropriate distance, which is required to align the 
aeroplane onto the final approach. Such maneuvers shall be conducted to enable the aeroplane to: 
1. 
Attain a controlled and stable descent path to the intended landing runway, and 
2. 
Remain within the circling area in such a way that visual contact with the runway of intended 
landing or the runway environment is maintained at all times. 
The published missed approach for the instrument approach should be followed. If visual reference is 
lost while circling to land after the aeroplane has departed from the initial instrument approach track, 
the missed approach specified for that particular instrument approach should be followed. It is expected

8.3.19.2.22.5 RNP AR Approach 
(OpSpec C84 RNP AR) Subject to GACA approval, E-book Volume 5, Chapter 2, Section 10,  
RNP Authorization Required (AR) is a special RNP approach procedure that requires additional 
authorizations. 
An RNP approach is defined as RNP AR, if any of these characteristics are present: 
1. 
Increased navigation accuracy (RNP <0.3) 
2. 
Use of Radius to a Fix (RF) legs 
3. 
Reduced lateral obstacle evaluation area on the missed approach (also referred to as a missed 
approach requiring RNP less than 1.0) 
4. 
Reduced secondary obstacle clearance area 
5. 
Qualification and additional procedures are required.  
During the preparation of a flight where RNP AR procedure will be flown, the flight crew must verify 
that the required equipment is serviceable. The appropriate FCOM and MEL lists the required equipment 
that must be considered to conduct an RNP AR approach. 
Navigation Database 
The on-board navigation database for an RNP AR approach must have: 
1. 
The capability to receive updates in accordance with 1 the AIRAC cycle. 
2. 
The navigation database should also allow retrieval and loading of RNP AR approach procedures 
into the FMS. 
3. 
The database must contain the waypoints and associated VNAV information, such as the altitudes 
and vertical angles for the procedure to be flown. 
4. 
Be protected against flight crew modifications of the stored data. 
Note: This does not preclude the flight crew from having the means to modify a procedure or route already 
loaded into the FMS. However, the procedures stored in the navigation database must remain intact within 
the navigation database for future use and reference. 
The crew shall refer to the type specific FCOM and flight information publications for specific guidance.

at the aeroplane. 
If communication cannot be established with GMS or NCC, the decision to divert rests with the PIC 
based on the information available. 
The PIC should contact the diversion aerodrome with the passenger details and illness or injury (as 
known) and arrange for local emergency response services to meet the aeroplane, if possible. 
The PIC shall not give any indication that Riyadh Air will accept responsibility for the costs of providing 
medical care. 
8.3.19.2.33.2 Diversion to Aerodromes with Company Support 
Upon arrival at the aerodrome, the PIC shall consult with the Riyadh Air ground personnel to determine 
the best course of action to minimize inconvenience to the passengers. 
If the aeroplane is expected to depart shortly after refueling, it is preferable to keep the passengers on 
board. If the passengers are to be kept on board, they shall remain the responsibility of the PIC. 
If passengers disembark, they will become the responsibility of the ground personnel. Passengers are 
required to take all their belongings, including baggage, with them. 
If the PIC expects that the length of the stay will exceed the flight time limitations, he should arrange 
hotel accommodation and transportation for the crew in cooperation with the ground personnel and 
NCC, as soon as practicable. Nevertheless, the crew shall not leave the aerodrome until suitable 
arrangements for the passengers have been made and the security and maintenance of the aeroplane 
is assured. 
At all times, the PIC shall liaise with the local ground personnel to ensure that any course of action 
decided upon does not infringe on any local regulations at that aerodrome.

8.5.1 
Definitions 
Extended Diversion Time Operations (EDTO) is any operation by an airplane with two or more turbine 
engines where the diversion time to an enroute alternate aerodrome is greater than the threshold time 
established by the State of the Operator.  EDTO and ETOPS are terms which are used in conjunction, 
and which are essentially the same.  Boeing uses the term ETOPS in their suite of manuals. 
8.5.1.1 
Extended Range Entry Point 
The extended range entry point is the first point on the airplane’s route which is at 60 min flying time 
at the approved one-engine-inoperative cruise speed (under standard conditions in still air) from an 
adequate aerodrome. 
8.5.1.2 
Extended Range Exit Point 
The extended range exit point is the last point on the airplane’s route which is at 60 min flying time at 
the approved one-engine-inoperative cruise speed (under standard conditions in still air) from an 
adequate aerodrome. 
8.5.1.3 
Equal Time Point (ETP) 
An equal time point (ETP) is the point of equal flying time between two ETOPS en-route alternate 
aerodromes, taking into account forecast wind and temperature. 
8.5.1.4 
Approved One Engine Inoperative (OEI) Cruise Speed 
The approved one-engine-inoperative cruise speed for the intended area of operation must be a speed, 
within the certificated limits of the airplane, selected by Riyadh Air and approved by the competent 
authority. 
The OEI cruise speed is used to: 
1. 
Establish the outer limit of the area of operation and any dispatch limitation, 
2. 
Calculation of single-engine fuel requirements 
3. 
Establish the level off altitude data. This level off altitude must clear any obstacle enroute by 
margins as specified in the operational requirements.

For dispatch of an airplane under ETOPS, both the Standard Fuel Planning (8.1.7.2) and the ETOPS Fuel 
Planning shall be calculated, requiring the fuel to be uplifted be the greater amount of the two 
calculations. 
8.5.2.1 
ETOPS Fuel Planning 
Fuel planning for an ETOPS flight shall consider the potential for an en-route diversion to a designated 
ETOPS en-route alternate aerodrome, from the most critical ETOPS ETP (Critical ETP) between 
designated ETOPS alternate aerodromes, by calculating and considering the ETOPS. 
Critical Fuel Scenario. 
This fuel planning is split into two parts: 
1. 
Standard fuel scenario from departure to the Critical ETP. 
2. 
Critical Fuel Scenario from the Critical ETP to the diversion aerodrome. 
The Critical ETP is the ETP exhibiting the lowest fuel surplus or the highest fuel deficit. The highest fuel 
deficit is considered to be the required additional ETOPS fuel reserve. 
If the ETOPS sector is covered by only one suitable aerodrome, the critical fuel will be based on ETOPS 
entry and exit point, and in most cases the latter will be the most critical. 
8.5.2.2 
ETOPS Critical Fuel Scenario 
The ETOPS Critical Fuel requirement considers the potential for the following three failure scenarios 
from the most fuel critical ETOPS ETP with their respective diversion profiles and consequent fuel 
requirements. 
The fuel requirements for each of the three failure cases are then compared to the standard fuel 
requirement, and the highest quantity will be uplifted. 
This fuel uplift will then assure safe completion of the flight, regardless of flight scenario (normal flight 
or diversion). 
The Three separate failure scenarios are: 
1. 
Engine Failure 
a. 
Descent at the selected speed cruise to the selected level schedule, 
b. 
Diversion cruise at the selected level and speed. 
2. 
Depressurization 
a. 
Emergency descent at Vmo/Mmo (speed brakes extended) down to FL100, 
b. 
Diversion cruise performed at the selected speed schedule. 
3. 
Depressurization and One Engine Failure

a. 
Emergency descent at Vmo/Mmo (speed brakes extended) down to FL100, 
b. 
Diversion cruise at the selected speed schedule. 
The ETOPS Critical Fuel Scenario is defined as follows: 
1. 
Descent from the normal cruise altitude at the selected speed schedule, 
2. 
Cruise at the required diversion level and speed, 
3. 
Normal Descent to 1,500 ft above the diversion aerodrome, 
4. 
15 minutes holding, 
5. 
First approach and missed approach as an instrument procedure, 
6. 
Second approach and landing as visual circuit. 
8.5.2.3 
Additional Fuel Reserves 
ETOPS requires that additional fuel be added to the fuel calculated in the three cases above to allow 
for: 
1. 
Contingency fuel (5%), 
2. 
Performance factor for each individual airplane, 
3. 
APU fuel consumption (if required), 
4. 
Icing penalty (for total anti-ice, engine, and wing, at 10,000 ft), 
5. 
Effect of any CDL and/or MEL items. 
The OFP calculates the fuel requirements for the two engines and single engine depressurized cases 
using the actual airplane weight at the Critical ETP. 
It automatically selects the higher of the two fuel requirements (the single engine pressurized case is 
never limiting). 
Contingency fuel, airplane performance factor, and APU fuel consumption are automatically calculated 
by the OFP. 
Icing and MEL/CDL penalties are applied by Flight Dispatch, if required. 
8.5.3 
ETOPS En-route Alternate Aerodrome 
For ETOPS operations, Flight Dispatch will check that appropriate ETOPS en-route alternate aerodromes

Should the weather at a selected alternate deteriorate below landing minima prior to entering the 
ETOPS segment, or whilst in the ETOPS segment, another alternate shall be nominated that satisfies the 
weather requirements. 
If this is not possible, the flight must not enter the ETOPS segment. If already in the ETOPS segment, 
the PIC shall decide whether to continue or if fuel on board permits, re-route on a non-ETOPS route. 
8.5.5 
ETOPS Aeroplane Requirements 
8.5.5.1 
MEL/CDL Considerations 
ETOPS serviceability requirements are more restrictive than for normal operations. Riyadh Air 
Engineering will maintain a list of significant systems for each airplane type that will affect ETOPS 
operations in some way. 
Any systems deficiencies that may have an impact on the dispatch of the airplane under ETOPS are 
notified to NCC prior to dispatch. 
These items are to be reviewed by the Flight Crew to assess what effect they may have in terms of 
additional dispatch requirements and/or limitations. 
Before an ETOPS flight, the ETOPS Supplement Maintenance Check shall be signed by an authorized 
engineer approved by Riyadh Air Engineering. 
After dispatch, the MEL is not applicable and should not be considered limiting at this stage. It should 
be used for crew information only. 
In case of a diversion caused by non-technical reasons, the ETOPS Supplement Maintenance Check will 
remain valid for the subsequent flight provided it is confirmed that the ETOPS serviceability 
requirements have not be changed since the last signed ETOPS Supplement Maintenance Check. 
8.5.5.2 
ETOPS Verification Flight 
Verification flights are a requirement following certain significant maintenance actions as defined by 
Riyadh Air Engineering. An ETOPS verification flight may be accomplished during an ETOPS flight, a 
non-ETOPS flight or on a dedicated non-revenue flight. 
Should an ETOPS flight be used, the in-flight verification shall be accomplished during the first 60 min 
of the flight and before the airplane enters the ETOPS segment. 
The procedure affecting Flight Operations is as follows: 
1. 
Engineering will determine the requirement for an ETOPS Verification Flight after reviewing the 
Aircraft Technical Log,

2. 
If an ETOPS Verification Flight is required, this requirement shall be recorded in the Technical Log 
by entering ‘ETOPS Verification Flight Required’ in the Defect Column of the Aircraft Technical 
Log Sector Record for the incoming flight and deferred by raising an ADD, 
3. 
The ETOPS box of the logbook should be signed by the engineer before the flight, 
4. 
A ‘Notice to Crew’ will be raised requesting the crew to carry out an ETOPS Verification Flight, 
5. 
The Dispatch Duty Manager shall be notified immediately, 
6. 
After completing 60 min of the flight, the PIC will record in the “Defect” column of the Technical 
Log Sector Record “ETOPS Verification Flight satisfactory”, if no defects were apparent that would 
affect an ETOPS dispatch, 
7. 
The ADD will be cleared at the next station using the Technical Log Sector Record reference for 
the satisfactory flight. 
In considering the fuel requirements for the flight, the PIC, in consultation with the Dispatch Duty 
Manager and the Senior Engineer Shift, may elect to carry sufficient fuel to complete the sector via a 
non- 
ETOPS routing. Factors affecting this decision may include, but are not necessarily limited to: 
1. 
The desirability of minimizing disturbance to network scheduling, 
2. 
Previous technical history of the airplane, 
3. 
Availability of en-route engineering support, 
4. 
Commercial implications of excess fuel on the payload, 
5. 
Available non-ETOPS routings and entry points, 
6. 
Forecast en-route weather. 
8.5.6 
ETOPS In-flight Procedures 
ETOPS procedures shall be conducted in accordance with respective type specific documentation. 
During flight, either before or during an ETOPS segment, a re-routing or diversion is required when: 
1. 
Failures occur requiring a diversion to the nearest aerodrome, in accordance with the respective 
type specific documentation, 
2. 
Failures occur requiring a non-ETOPS routing, in accordance with the respective type specific 
documentation, 
3. 
Failures occur resulting in excessive fuel consumption, exceeding the available ETOPS Critical Fuel, 
4. 
Weather minima at nominated suitable aerodrome(s) go below the aerodrome operating minima 
or become unsuitable for any reason prior to reaching the entry point.

In the event of an ETOPS diversion due to an engine failure, the Flight Crew shall determine the best 
speed, altitude and thrust setting for the single engine flight to the alternate. 
The fuel is predicated on flying the ETOPS diversion speed but if, in the judgement of the Flight Crew, 
it is better to fly a different speed, then they may deviate and fly the best speed based on the 
circumstances. 
8.5.7 
ETOPS Flight Watch 
Flight Dispatch maintains a flight watch for ETOPS flights. 
The flight watch personnel monitor: 
1. 
Weather forecasts and reports for ETOPS en-route alternate aerodromes, 
2. 
En-route weather forecasts and SIGMETs, 
3. 
Any alteration to the status of ETOPS en-route alternate aerodrome facilities. 
Should any factor render an en-route alternate unsuitable, they will contact the Flight Crew and assist 
with any re-planning that may be required, such as selection of different en-route alternates, fuel 
requirements, re-routing, etc.

USE OF MINIMUM EQUIPMENT AND CONFIGURATION 
DEVIATION LIST  
GACAR Part 121.517 
8.6.1 
Minimum Equipment List (MEL) 
The MEL is a Saudi GACA approved document that lists the equipment, systems and installations that 
may be unserviceable before a particular flight is undertaken, without invalidating the Certificate of 
Airworthiness. 
The list includes any additional limitations, conditions and required procedures which may apply to 
flights with such items inoperative. The MEL forms part of Operations Manual Part B. 
The MEL provides the PIC with the authority to operate the airplane with specified items of equipment 
unserviceable, but it must be emphasized that, irrespective of the provisions of the MEL, he is not 
obliged to operate with a particular defect or defects, if in his opinion, these unserviceabilities could 
adversely affect the safety of a proposed flight. 
While the MEL considers the area and types of operation, such as ETOPS, MNPS/NAT-HLA or RVSM, 
and including whether the airplane is being dispatched from base or an outstation, it cannot address 
multiple unserviceabilities. The PIC shall take these issues, together with operational aspects such as the 
likely weather conditions, into consideration before deciding whether a dispatch under the MEL is 
acceptable. 
8.6.2 
Configuration Deviation List (CDL) 
The CDL is a Saudi GACA approved document that lists the airplane panels, doors, and hatches, etc., 
that may be missing, and those areas of the airplane skin/structure that may be damaged without 
invalidating the Certificate of Airworthiness. 
8.6.3 
Use of MEL and CDL 
An airplane is not permitted to dispatch with a defect that has not been processed in accordance with 
the procedures detailed in the Minimum Equipment List (MEL) and/or Configuration Deviation List 
(CDL). If a fault that cannot be immediately rectified is discovered during servicing or inspection of the 
airplane, it shall be reported to the PIC and action decided in accordance with the MEL/CDL. 
Each airplane MEL contains detailed procedures regarding its scope and applicability. 
Flight Crews shall not assist in airborne or ground troubleshooting of defects unless such procedures 
are documented in the respective type specific documentation.
