Protocol for Relieving the PIC The Pilot in Command (PIC) may only be relieved by a pilot who possesses the necessary qualifications and credentials to serve in this capacity. During the period of relief, this pilot assumes all roles and responsibilities traditionally associated with the PIC. However, it is important to note that despite undertaking the duties of the PIC, the in-flight relief pilot retains the official designation of Second in Command (SIC) throughout the flight. This designation is maintained to ensure adherence to the established chain of command protocols.
