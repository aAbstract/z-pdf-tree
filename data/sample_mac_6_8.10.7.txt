Communication System 1. Interphone and Passenger Address System The interphone and passenger address system is integrated into one telephone-type handset which provides for making cabin to cabin calls and cabin to flight deck calls. A specific single number will connect the call to the desired location. A three-digit code, 2-2-2 for pilot alert, will chime three times and connect to the flight deck, or join any communications being made between the flight deck and another crew station. 2. Operation: a. Lift handset and press appropriate code to initiate the call; b. Press reset button after call completion and stow handset. 3. Codes: a. 2 will connect the cabin to the flight deck. b. 5 will connect attendant to attendant. c. 8 is the PA system. Use of the PA will override the passenger entertainment system, allowing all announcements to be heard. 4. 2-2-2 will connect to the flight deck as an emergency call. NOTE: If a flight deck PA announcement is made, it will override any other PA announcement.
