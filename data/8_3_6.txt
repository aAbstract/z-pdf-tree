Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS)/Airborne Collision Avoidance System (ACAS)  GACAR PART 121 APPENDIX G – (a) (33), 91.237   IOSA 3.11.3 The Traffic Collision and Avoidance System (TCAS) is to be used on all flights in accordance with respective type specific documentation unless special approval dictates differently.  It remains the responsibility of the Flight Crew to avoid collision with another airplane. During critical phases of the flight, including in the vicinity of an aerodrome, during descent and climb-out, and in areas where traffic is dense, Flight Crew shall keep additional workload, such as completing paperwork, map reading, etc., to a minimum.  Use of the autopilot is recommended to facilitate a good lookout. ATC only reports known traffic. If unidentified traffic is reported by ATC, and a collision risk is suspected, request immediate avoiding action.  Only ICAO standard phraseology as listed in (4) below shall be used in relation to TCAS.  Indications generated by TCAS shall be used by pilots in conformity with the following safety considerations: 1. Traffic Advisory (TA):  a. Flight Crew shall not maneuver an airplane in response to a TA. Following a TA, Flight Crew shall prepare for appropriate action if an RA occurs.  2. Resolution Advisories (RA):  a. Flight Crew shall follow all RAs. Visually acquired traffic may not be the same traffic as has triggered an RA. Visual perception of an encounter may be misleading, particularly at nighttime. ATC may not know when TCAS issues RAs. It is possible for ATC to issue instructions that are unknowingly contrary to RA indications.  3. The alteration of flight path shall be limited to the minimum extent necessary to comply with the RA.  4. Pilots who deviate from an ATC instruction or clearance in response to an RA shall:  a. After initiating the maneuver, and as soon as permitted by Flight Crew workload, notify the appropriate ATC unit of the deviation as follows: “(Call Sign), TCAS RA”.  b. Promptly return to the terms of the ATC instruction or clearance when the conflict is resolved.

Notify ATC when, or after, returning to the current clearance as follows: “(Call Sign), clear of conflict, returning to (assigned clearance)” or, as appropriate: “(Call Sign), clear of conflict, (assigned clearance) resumed”. d. If ATC issues an instruction contradictory to an RA, pilots shall follow the RA and inform ATC: “(Call Sign), Unable, TCAS RA”.  In order to reduce unnecessary TCAS alerts, the vertical speed should be limited to 1,500 ft/min or less when within 1,000 ft of the assigned altitude/ FL when in proximity of other traffic and it is safe and practical to do so.
